/**
 ***************************************************************************
 * Description:
 * Given an array of integers, find two numbers such that they add up to 
 * a specific target number. 
 * The function twoSum should return indices of the two numbers such that 
 * they add up to the target, where index1 must be less than index2. 
 * Please note that your returned answers (both index1 and index2) are not 
 * zero-based. 
 * 
 * You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution. 
 * Input: numbers={2, 7, 11, 15}, target=9 
 * Output: index1=1, index2=2
