/**
 *************************************************************************
 * Description:
 * 
 * Given an array with n objects colored red, white or blue, sort them so 
 * that objects of the same color are adjacent, with the colors in the order 
 * red, white and blue. 
 * 
 * Here, we will use the integers 0, 1, and 2 to represent the color red, 
 * white, and blue respectively. 
 * 
 * Note: 
 * You are not suppose to use the library's sort function for this problem. 
 * 
 * Follow up: 
 * Could you come up with an one-pass algorithm using only constant space?
 *
