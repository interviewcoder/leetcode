 * Description:
 * 
 * The demons had captured the princess (P) and imprisoned her in the 
 * bottom-right corner of a dungeon. The dungeon consists of M x N rooms 
 * laid out in a 2D grid. Our valiant knight (K) was initially positioned 
 * in the top-left room and must fight his way through the dungeon to rescue 
 * the princess. 
 * 
 * The knight has an initial health point represented by a positive integer. 
 * If at any point his health point drops to 0 or below, he dies immediately. 
 * Some of the rooms are guarded by demons, so the knight loses health 
 * (negative integers) upon entering these rooms; other rooms are either empty
 * (0's) or contain magic orbs that increase the knight's health (positive integers). 
 * 
 * In order to reach the princess as quickly as possible, the knight decides 
 * to move only rightward or downward in each step. 
 * 
 * Write a function to determine the knight's minimum initial health so that 
 * he is able to rescue the princess.
 * 
 * Notes: 
 * 
 * The knight's health has no upper bound. 
 * Any room can contain threats or power-ups, even the first room the knight 
 * enters and the bottom-right room where the princess is imprisoned.
