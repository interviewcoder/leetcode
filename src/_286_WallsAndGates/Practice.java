/**
 ***************************************************************************
 * Description:
 * 
 * You are given a m x n 2D grid initialized with these three possible values. 
 * 
 * 1. -1 - A wall or an obstacle. 
 * 2. 0 - A gate. 
 * 3. INF - Infinity means an empty room. We use the value 231 - 1 = 2147483647 
 * to represent INF as you may assume that the distance to a gate is less than 2147483647.
 * 
 * Fill each empty room with the distance to its nearest gate. If it is 
 * impossible to reach a gate, it should be filled with INF. 
 * 
 * For example, given the 2D grid: 
 * INF  -1  0  INF 
 * INF INF INF  -1 
 * INF  -1 INF  -1 
 * 0  -1 INF INF 
 * 
 * After running your function, the 2D grid should be: 
 * 3  -1   0   1 
 * 2   2   1  -1 
 * 1  -1   2  -1 
 * 0  -1   3   4
