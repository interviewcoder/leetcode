/**
 *************************************************************************
 * Description: 
 * 
 * Given two words (beginWord and endWord), and a dictionary, find the 
 * length of shortest transformation sequence from beginWord to endWord, 
 * such that: 
 *      Only one letter can be changed at a time 
 *      Each intermediate word must exist in the dictionary 
 * 
 * For example, 
 * Given: start = "hit" end = "cog" 
 * dict = ["hot","dot","dog","lot","log"] 
 * As one shortest transformation is "hit" -> "hot" -> "dot" -> "dog" -> "cog", 
 * 
 * return its length 5.
