 * Description: 
 * 
 * Follow up for "Unique Paths": 
 * Now consider if some obstacles are added to the grids. How many unique 
 * paths would there be? 
 * An obstacle and empty space is marked as 1 and 0 respectively in the grid. 
 * 
 * For example, 
 * There is one obstacle in the middle of a 3x3 grid as illustrated below. 
 * [ 
 *  [0,0,0], 
 *  [0,1,0], 
 *  [0,0,0] 
 * ] 
 * The total number of unique paths is 2.
